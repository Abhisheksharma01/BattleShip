# Project Title

BattleShip is a turn-based two-player game that simulates a war between ships on an ocean.
Each player gets their own battle area with a certain number of ships placed in non-overlapping positions. The ships
might be of different sizes. Note, players cannot see each others ship's location.

### Prerequisites

 The code is compatible with node version >=8.12.0

    The entry point to the souce code is src/main.js. So either we can directly run this file from node or can also be executed via npm. Both are explained below.

### via node
    node <path to the entry point> <input file path>
 
    e.g. node src\main.js .\..\..\thoughtWorks\draw.txt


    
### via npm
    or we can  run it from npm script as :

    npm start <input file path>

    e.g. npm start .\..\..\thoughtWorks\draw.txt

### Output

The output of the program would be printed to the console itself in the same manner as expected.

## Running the tests

Unit test cases can be executed via the below command from the same directory:
